            <h1>How GSBurnCals Works</h1>
            <p> Exercise, burn calories, and you raise your <i>Fuelscore</i>!  Input your <i>FuelBand</i> data to earn <i>points</i> and gain <i>status</i>.  Use your points to play the game, tip the scale, and win <i>rewards</i>! </p>
            <p>Get started on Fri, Feb 15th  by uploading you FuelBand data from the 14th.  You must make your last upload and <b>play out all your points</b> before the program ends at 12pm on Wednesday March 13th.  </p>
            </section>

            <section id="fuelband">
            <h1>FuelBand</h1>
            <h3>What kinds of activity does the FuelBand track?</h3>
            <p>The FuelBand measures acceleration, so any activity involving arm movement will increase your FuelScore.  The band tracks aerobic activities like running, walking, dancing, and basketball effectively, but is less suited for resistance workouts, like weight lifting and yoga.  The FuelBand is not optimized to track bicycle workouts, though it will capture some data if worn for cycling.</p>
            <p>DO NOT SWIM while wearing your FuelBand.  The device is water resistant, but NOT waterproof.</p>

            <h3>Is the FuelBand waterproof?</h3>
            <p>NO.  It is water resistant, but it should not be submerged.</p>

            <section id="points">
            <h1>Points</h1>
            <h3>How do I earn points?</h3>
            <p> When you input your FuelScore, you earn points for your physical activity, as well as a <i>daily input bonus</i>.  The points you earn from your fuel score are calculated as follows:</p>

            <table class="table table-striped">
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th> FuelScore Credits </th>
                        <th> Points </th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td> First 2000 FuelScore </td>
                        <td> 1pt/100 FuelScore </td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td> 2001st-3000th FuelScore </td>
                        <td> 1pt/50 FuelScore </td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>

                        <td> 1pt/25 FuelScore </td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            <p> For example, if today&#39;s FuelScore is 2500, you will earn 20 points for your first 2000 FuelScore, and 10 points for your next 500, for a total of 30 points. Your points round up.</p>
            <p> Each day that you input your FuelScore, you receive a <a class="link" href="#input">daily input bonus</a>, which varies in value according to your <a class="link" href="#status">status</a>. </p>

            <h3>How do I use points I have earned?</h3>

            <section id="game">
            <h1>Game</h1>
            <h3>What are the scales?</h3>
            <p>You can choose to play any of the three scales on the game board.  The right side of each scale is weighed down by an unknown amount of cash.  Players add points to the scale to weigh down the left side.  Each 10 points are equivalent to 5 cents.  Once the dollar equivalent of the points on the left side of the scale equals the cash value on the right side of the scale, the scale tips and the player who added the last point wins all of the cash. The winning player will only spend just enough points to tip the scale; no extra points will be taken. Once a scale has tipped, a new one replaces it and the game starts over.</p>

            <h3>How much cash is likely to be on the right side of the scale?</h3>
            <p>The probability that the amount of cash on the right side of the scale is any given amount is uniform between $2 and $20. Thus, a $20 prize is just as likely to occur as a $2 prize.  Over the course of the quarter, a few prizes between $20 and $100 will be given out.</p>

            <h3>When do I get my prizes?</h3>
            <p>At the end of the quarter, you can cash out your rewards with Coupa Cafe Card.</p>
